  <h1>
  The Cost of Mobile Broadband
  </h1>
  <p>
    Having lived in a third world country, I remember the disparity in mobile access.  This was over five years ago but it got me thinking.  How do prices for mobile data vary across the world?  Just how difficult is it for the average person in other countries to afford normal usage? The visualization below helps to illustrate this with a choropleth map.  The difference in cost between small and large plans can be compared, and cost itself can be seen as either a dollar amount per gigabyte, or as a percentage of the average income for that country.

    Looking at the average cost per gigabyte, it's not easy to see any patterns emerging from the map.  However, if we view cost as a percentage of income, there is a clear swath of darker color starting from the bottom left of the map extending up and towards the right.  This band covers a good number of lesser developed countries in South America, Africa, and Asia where mobile broadband for the average person appears to be practically out of reach.  North America (with the exception of Mexico), Europe, and Australia have a lighter hue indicating that most people in these areas can easily afford mobile broadband.
